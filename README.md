# Resource-Analyzer-C++

## Motive
I completed this project for my systems programming course freshman year. While the class was taught in C, for my final project I wanted to adventure outside of my comfort zone and utilize the libraries available with C++ to access more indepth system information about our school computer science server, Odin.

## Usage
This program displays information about the user's system over a period of time determined by the user.

The user can input a directory that they would like to know more information about such as how much space said directory takes up on the user's system, the total RAM and RAM in use by the system, the number of processors in use, and more, all in a readable format.
